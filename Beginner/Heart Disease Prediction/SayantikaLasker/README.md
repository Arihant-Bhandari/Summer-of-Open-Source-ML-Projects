# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION PROJECT

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health indicators and medical data. The prediction model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the input features and provide a probability or classification indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information on several health parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors. It includes both the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease as well as features that may influence it.

- **Dataset Source:** [Heart Disease Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data)

## Model
The heart disease prediction model is built using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on another portion to assess its performance and generalization ability.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and preprocessed. This may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Model Training:** Select the appropriate machine learning algorithm(s) and train the model using the prepared dataset.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve performance if necessary.
4. **Prediction:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict heart disease likelihood for new patients by providing their relevant health parameters as input.

## Files
- `heart_disease_data.csv`: The dataset containing patient information and target variable.
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Results
Provide a summary of the model's performance metrics and any insights gained from the analysis of the data.

## Future Work
- Explore more advanced machine learning techniques or ensemble methods to further improve prediction accuracy.
- Gather additional data or features that may enhance the model's predictive power.
- Deploy the model as a web application or integrate it into a healthcare system for real-time predictions.
