This code is a comprehensive demonstration of how to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model using PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library. The model is designed to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset, which is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories.

Here’s a breakdown of what each section of the code does:
->	Model Definition: The FashionMNISTModelV1 class defines the architecture of the neural network. It uses a >combination of linear (fully connected) and non-linear (ReLU) layers. The nn.Flatten() layer flattens the input >images into a single vector, which is then passed through two nn.Linear() layers with a nn.ReLU() activation >function in between.
->	Model Initialization: The model is initialized with a specific input size (784, corresponding to the >flattened 28x28 images), a hidden layer size of 10, and an output size equal to the number of classes in the >dataset. The model is then moved to the GPU if one is available.
->	Loss Function and Optimizer: The code defines a CrossEntropy loss function, which is suitable for multi-class >classification problems. It also sets up a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, which will be used to >update the model’s weights based on the calculated gradients.
->	Training and Testing Functions: The train_step and test_step functions encapsulate the training and testing >processes respectively. During training, the model makes predictions (forward pass), calculates the loss, >computes gradients (backward pass), and updates the weights (optimizer step). During testing, the model simply >makes predictions and calculates the loss and accuracy.
->	Model Training: The model is trained for 30 epochs ,which took around 85 seconds to complete. For each epoch, >the training and testing steps are carried out, and the loss and accuracy are printed out.
->	Model Evaluation: Finally, the eval_model function evaluates the model on a given dataset and returns the >loss and accuracy.

From this project, I learned how to construct a neural network in PyTorch, handle data with DataLoader, train a model using a GPU, and evaluate the model’s performance. I also gained a deeper understanding of the role of loss functions, optimizers, and activation functions in neural network training. This project has been a valuable step in my journey towards mastering machine learning and deep learning concepts.
